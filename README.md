code made in 1 day (quite happy about the result)
After some research while coding the ia of the monsters in the last game (in the end I did the simplest) i saw that it was possible to use the map's matrix, so that the monster could find its way in space when moving.
But i couldn't find a tutorial or anything to teach me how to do it, so i decided to do it myself with small hint i found and make an executable to automatically transform the tiled map into a matrix with this program (maybe it'll come in usefull later).

## **how it works ?**

I'll use my tiled game files as an example
- put the scrip or .exe in the folder with you'r .tmx map and his data (sprite sheet .png and .tsx)

- in Tiled, all objects that must have a collision must be named with "collision" in their name

After it, it's done, just follow the program and you will have you'r matrix.json usable

And here the result

-> Tiled map :
