code made in 1 day (quite happy about the result)
After some research while coding the ia of the monsters in the last game (in the end I did the simplest) i saw that it was possible to use the map's matrix, so that the monster could find its way in space when moving.
But i couldn't find a tutorial or anything to teach me how to do it, so i decided to do it myself with small hint i found and make an executable to automatically transform the tiled map into a matrix with this program (maybe it'll come in usefull later).

how it works ?
